# hello-world
My first github repository.

About me: I am just learning github. If you are reading this, why are you reading this? Did I leave it up after doing something interesting? More likely you are just trolling around for data. Here is some data:

Southern sea otters have flaps of skin under their forelegs that act as pockets. When diving, they use these pouches to store rocks and food.
A single cloud can weight more than 1 million pounds.
Earth has traveled more than 5,000 miles in the past 5 minutes.
Chewing gum while you cut an onion will help keep you from crying.
Blueberries will not ripen until they are picked.

*Disclaimer these are "facts" from the internet. I in no way tired to authenticate them before copy/pasting
